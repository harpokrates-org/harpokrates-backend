      description: 'In 1984 I got my first Camera, a Nikon FE2 which I still have. It took me a few years before I had a clue what I was doing with it. In the late 80’s I started taking picture of mostly models until about the mid 90’s. I stopped doing that and begun taking wedding photos for friends, family and the occasional friend of a friend using rented Hasselblad equipment. I slowly lost interest in that and only took pictures of my family.\n\n“Sigpho” is short for Signature Photography, in case you’re wondering about the name. It was the name I used during my wedding and modeling days.\n\nIn 2003 I got my first digital camera, a Canon G2. It took incredible close-ups but it lacked the speed and details I was use to with film, especially medium format. In 2005 I got a Nikon D70 with a kit lens. I enjoyed not having to buy and develop film, but wasn’t too happy with the digital resolution. For several years I stopped taking pictures and only took the camera out during holidays. \n\nIt wasn’t until August of 2010 a good friend got me back into it. I had lost my appetite for taking pictures until I started looking at some of his work and the incredible photo’s on Flickr (see some of my favorites). I still use the D70 but now with a few pro-grade lenses. \n\nThanks to all of you, I’m starting to rekindle my desire for something I once loved. After looking at some of my fellow flickr photographers, I feel I’ve lost a fair bit of ground over the years. Nevertheless, I once again really love taking pictures just as much as I love looking at them. I spend most of my time these days in awe of some of the work on this site.\n\nHopefully you’ll find something in my photostream that’s a little pleasing to your eyes. Enjoy and thanks.\n\n\nThanks for the visit.',
